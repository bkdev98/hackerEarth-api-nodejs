<h1> Welcome </h1>

Feel free to open an issue for bug or a PR for feature.

I would be more than happy to see it and fix/merge it. So go ahead :).

<h2> How to </h2>
	- Clone this repo.
	- Run `npm install` or it's shorthand `npm i`.
	- Source files are in `source\` directory.
	- Make changes in `source\` directory.
	- Run your code against linting errors using `npm run lint` 
		* If passed then go ahead.
		* If failed please see the reason and fix it because code quality of our project should remain high.
	- If you wants to see build files then run `npm run build` .
		* It will create a `distribution\` directory of final transpiled build.
	- Else Just submit a patch or PR.

<h3> Thanks and All the best.</h3>
